  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hello, I'm Thain√°, but you can call me Thai. I'm a biomedical scientist with a passion for computer sciences.
    Currently, I am pursuing a degree in analysis and systems development, where I am expanding my knowledge and skills
    in programming and software development. I am eagerly seeking work opportunities to gain hands-on experience in the 
    computer sciences field.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond my academic pursuits, I have a diverse range of interests and hobbies. I enjoy exploring nature through hiking, 
    experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, indulging my sweet tooth through baking, getting lost in captivating books, 
    and being a big fan of cinema.
  </p>
  <p>
    My mission is one of lifelong learning. I believe in continuously acquiring new knowledge and skills to adapt to the ever-evolving
    world of technology and make meaningful contributions to society.
    <br />
